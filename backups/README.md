# Backups
The folder for every save that has been done. The latest is used, unless it is corrupted, which in that case uses the 2nd latest.

## File name formatting
The formatting goes as it follows:
```
Breadocalypse_[month]-[day]-[year].pmp
```
Where: 
- `[month]` is replaced with the month **in a number between 1 and 12**
- `[day]` is replaced with the day **in a number between 1 and 31** (or higher if it SOMEHOW happens)
- `[year]` is replaced with the year **in a number between this year and this year**

Proper filenames:
- `Breadocalypse_2-19-2024.pmp`
- `Breadocalypse_12-31-2023.pmp`
- `Breadocalypse_7-4-2022.pmp`

Improper filenames:
- `Breadocalypse_13-25-2024.pmp` (Month exceeds 12)
- `Breadocalypse_6-31-2023.pmp` (Day exceeds maximum for the month)
- `Breadocalypse_11-15-2025.pmp` (Year exceeds current year)
- `Super_Mario_11-15-2025.pmp` (Incorrect game name)
- `Whopper.mp4` (worst format + monthless + dayless + yearless + wrong game + wrong filetype)
