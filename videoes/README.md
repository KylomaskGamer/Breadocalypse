# Videos
The folder for every footage recording that has been done. 

## File name formatting
The formatting goes as it follows:
```
[score]-[month]-[day]-[year].webm
```
Where: 
- `[score]` is replaced with the FORMATTED score of the run, where the `.` is seperated with a `-` (because filename and extension are split with `.`) or a set title such as `showcase` if starting upgrade modification is used (e.g. showcasing a boss or a gimmick)
- `[month]` is replaced with the month **in a number between 1 and 12**
- `[day]` is replaced with the day **in a number between 1 and 31** (or higher if it SOMEHOW happens)
- `[year]` is replaced with the year **in a number between this year and this year**

also it dosent have to end with .webm, but it must be a video file

Proper filenames:
- `12-06K_2-7-2024.webm`
- `9-5K_11-30-2023.webm`
- `82_4-15-2022.webm`
- `showcase-7-9-2021.webm`

Improper filenames:
- `38.5-03_6-31-2023.webm` (Score should be formatted without a decimal)
- `43592.432K_7-2-2022.webm` (Badly Formatted)
- `15-04_6-31-2023.webm` (Day exceeds maximum for the month)
- `6-8_11-15-2025.webm` (Year exceeds current year)
- `Whopper.png` (worst format + scoreless + terrible score formatting + monthless + dateless + yearless + not a video)

> [!TIP]
> The `[score]` does not have to be fixed to a set score or `showcase`. You can describe its purpose in one word such as `coolthing` or `geometrydashdashspiderpart` or `idunnodowhatyouwant`

> [!WARNING]  
> Files not adhering to the file naming format or violating the Code of Conduct will be subject to renaming or removal, depending on KylomaskGamer's decision.
