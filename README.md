# Breadocalypse

Yo, welcome to my game zone! This is the game's HQ, where I spill the tea on progress, stash backups for when the project goes bananas, and all that jazz.

And guess what? We've got some epic discussions going on too!

## How to play??

It's all about that bread, my friend. Smash it, level up, smash more, face bosses, level up again, shed a tear, and repeat the cycle. Easy peasy, right? :D

Controls are as chill as a breeze:

- AD - Move
- W - Jump
- JL - Turn Gun
- K - ***KILL.*** (Get ready for some serious bread annihilation!)
- M - Open/Close shop

## How to Contribute?

Alright, fam, if you're itching to contribute and spice up the breadocalypse, follow these steps like a pro:

1. Go to [PenguinMod Studio](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html).
2. Navigate like a boss: File > Load from your computer.
3. Cherry-pick that PMP file you're jazzed about, maybe snag one from the backups folder if you're feeling adventurous.
