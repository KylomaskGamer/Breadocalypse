# Skins
Basically the library for the skins. `default pang.bctm` is used by default.

## How to add a skin in there
1. Create a skin using the Breadocalypse Skin Builder. It should be somehwere in my repos.
2. Do the fork
3. Shove in the skin in `.bctm` in the `skins` folder
4. Do a pull request
5. Do not add innapropriate skins PLEASE (or your pull request is rejected immediately)
